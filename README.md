# BuildingLinearRegressionModel

This jupyter notebook is aimed at taking data from Carnegie Mellon Universities StatLab libarary, pretaining to automobile statistics. The dataset was originally used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. The goal is to use the data provided, to create a linear regression model that can predict the target variable MPG, given several variables such as cylinder count, model year, and weight. The strategies used included Extract Transform Load, Exploritory Data Analysis, Residual Examination, and Model Evaluations.
